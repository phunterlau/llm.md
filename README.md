# MarkDownload - Markdown Web Clipper

[![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/deathau/markdownload?style=for-the-badge&sort=semver)](https://github.com/deathau/markdownload/releases/latest)

This is an extension to clip websites and download them into a readable markdown file. Please keep in mind that it is not guaranteed to work on all websites.

To use this add-on, simply click the add-on icon while you are browsing the page you want to save offline. A popup will show the rendered markdown so you can make minor edits or copy the text, or you can click the download button to download an .md file.  
Selecting text will allow you to download just the selected text

## âœ¨ LLM Optimization Feature

MarkDownload now includes an **LLM Optimization** feature designed to enhance markdown output for AI and Large Language Model processing:

### Features:
- **Structured YAML Frontmatter**: Automatically adds metadata including title, URL, date, author, excerpt, and tags
- **Clean Links**: Removes tracking parameters (utm_*, fbclid, gclid) for cleaner URLs
- **Enhanced Content Structure**: Optimizes formatting and whitespace for better AI parsing
- **Conditional Application**: Enable/disable via the settings page

### How to Enable:
1. Click the extension icon and then the gear icon to open settings
2. Check "Optimize Markdown for LLM" option
3. Save settings

When enabled, your markdown files will include structured metadata and cleaned content optimized for AI processing workflows.

## ðŸ”§ Manifest V3 Migration

This extension has been updated to use **Manifest V3**, the latest extension standard for Chrome and Edge browsers:

### Technical Improvements:
- **Modern Service Worker Architecture**: Replaced background scripts with service workers for better performance and security
- **Offscreen Document Support**: DOM operations now use offscreen documents for compatibility with service worker limitations
- **Updated APIs**: All deprecated APIs have been updated to their modern equivalents
- **Enhanced Security**: Improved permissions model and content security policies
- **Future-Proof**: Ensures compatibility with current and future browser versions

### For Developers:
- Background scripts migrated to `background-v3.js` service worker
- DOM operations moved to offscreen document (`src/offscreen/`)
- Updated from `tabs.executeScript` to `scripting.executeScript`
- Added proper error handling and timeout protection
- Maintained backward compatibility with all existing features

## Pricing
This is an open-source extension I made *for fun*. Its intention is to be completely free.
It's free on Firefox, Edge and Chrome (and other Chromium browsers),
but unfortunately for Safari there is a yearly developer fee, so I've decided to
charge a small price for the Safari version to help cover that cost.
Alternately, you can become a GitHub Sponsor for as little as $2 per month and
you can request a key for the Safari version.
Also, even if you're using the free version and you absolutely *have* to
send me money because you like it that much, feel free to throw some coins
in my hat via the following:
